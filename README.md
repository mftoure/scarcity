# scarcity

![live site](http://ascarcity.herokuapp.com/)

A simple web application built with Django and hosted on heroku.

Given a location and a year in the future,it tells you which plants will no longer be able to grow there and information about temperature and rainfall changes.

It was built on the sole purpose of getting more familiar with django and the MVC model.

It leverages two thid-party APIs:
- [trefle.io](https://docs.trefle.io/)
- [climate data api of world bank}(https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/902061-climate-data-api)


<span style="color:red">The trefle.io API is currently down, thus making the project obsolete.</span>
